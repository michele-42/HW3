    "Moreover, we want the field ```fees``` to collect numeric information. As you will see, you scraped textual information for this attribute in the dataset: sketch whatever method you need (using regex, for example, to find currency symbol) to collect information and, in case of multiple information, retrieve only the highest fees. Finally, once you have collected numerical information, you likely will have different currencies: this can be chaotic, so let chatGPT guide you in the choice and deployment of an API to convert this column to a common currency of your choice (it can be USD, EUR or whatever you want). Ultimately, you will have a ```float``` column renamed ```fees (CHOSEN COMMON CURRENCY)```."

Here, we challenge you to show a map of the courses found with the score defined in point 3. You should be able to identify at least the *city* and *country* for each MSc degree. You can find some ideas on how to create maps in Python [Here](https://plotly.com/python/maps/) and [Here](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-geospatial-data-in-python-e070374fe621) but you will maybe need further information for a proper visualization, like coordinates (latitude and longitude). You can retrieve this data using various tools:\n",

    "2. You can collect a list of unique places in the format (City, Country) and ask chatGPT (or, as usual, any other LLM chatbot) to provide you with a list of corresponding representative coordinates\n",
