# Submit the homework

In this section you find the instruction to submit your group assignment.

## When?
Homework 3 is due on [November 26th at 23:59:59](http://aris.me/index.php/data-mining-ds-2023). Any homework submitted after the deadline will be subjected to a penalisation with the following schema:

|   Delay  | Penalisation |
|:--------:|:------------:|
|  1 day |     -0.5     |
| 2 days |      -1      |
| 3 days |      -2      |
| 4 days |      -3      |
| 5 days |      -4      |

If you have particular problems to respect the deadline, please contact Aris directly (putting @Daniel in cc) and explain your situation clearly, mentioning your working group.


The maximum score you can get is 5.

## Where?
1. Each group must create __only one__ GitHub repository: follow these [steps](https://github.com/CriMenghini/ADM-HW4/blob/master/README.md) (replace ADM-HW4 with the name you give to the repository). 

2. Before the deadline you can push in the repository whatever you want. Any push after the deadline will be taken into account for the penalisation.

__Note__ :

* The state of the repository at deadline time corresponds to your submission.
* __[IMPORTANT]__ be sure to compile this [form TBD](). **Only ONE PERSON per group must fill out the form**.

## What?

The content of the repository is up to you. The mandatory files are:

* `README.md`: a Markdown file that explains the content of your repository. This is an [example](https://github.com/CriMenghini/Wikipedia/tree/master/Mention). It is important that for each file/folder you say what it contains. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) a cheatsheet to use Markdown.

* `main.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook that contains all the answers to your research and theoretical questions. The notebook must be clear, complete and tidy. [Here](https://github.com/dusicastepic/ADMSecondHomework/blob/master/ADM_HW2_Full.ipynb) an example of a nice notebook from previous years.
    - In general, for the sake of the tidiness of the Notebook, you are encouraged to save your functions in external .py files that you [import](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/modules) in the notebook.
    - Upload on GitHub the notebook with the cells already run
    - It might be possible that you do not see some plots. For this reason, we suggest you to put in the `README.md` a link that you create [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) just copying and paste the url of your notebook on GitHub.

* `commandline_original.[ext]`: the script file to answer the __1st point__ of the <ins>command line question</ins>
* `commandline_LLM.[ext]`: the script file to answer the __2nd point__ of the <ins>command line question</ins>

It __must not__ contain:
* The datasets you used (thus you should clearly state in the readme what dataset you used, if any not in the homework description). That's because git allows you to push only dataset smaller of a max size. [Here](https://haydar-ai.medium.com/learning-how-to-git-ignoring-files-and-folders-using-gitignore-4b6a1ec43ce1) a good Medium's post that tells you how to deal with files/directories you do not want to push on GitHub.

## Post Homework

Each student will (randomly) need to fill other 2 forms, that will be published after the deadline of the homework:

1. [Individual Feedback - (complete by TBD)](): a form to express how you worked with your group, and who did what.
2. [Peer Review  - (complete by TBD)](): you will receive an email, containing 2 pieces of homework that you have to review. You will find the guidelines of the review in the form. Please submit one different form for each repository reviewed. Peer review is intended to help you to develop your critical skills towards other people's work and to compare your work with that of others. 

You will have __5 days (120 hours)__ to fill the two forms after the HW submission. They are __mandatory__, i.e. we will not grade your homework if you won't fill all the forms.
